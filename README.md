##Merrps Followers and Lighting##
This fork tries to maintain vanilla compatibility whenever possible. It doesn't increase the size of any save data structure or the object event structure.

There are several branches, each with one main feature:

**followers** branch:
* [HGSS-style pokémon followers](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Walking_Pok%C3%A9mon#Pok.C3.A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver) for all 386 pokémon, including emotes, the 28 Unown forms and a majority of follower messages.
* Dynamic overworld palettes & reflections compatible with vanilla berry trees.
* Function to change a pokemon's nature while preserving most properties of its PID.
* Function to detect newer emulators/new GBA hardware.

**icons** branch:
* Everything from the **followers** branch.
* All pokemon icons updated to Gen 6, based on [this repo](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite/tree/master/icons/pokemon/regular)
* This includes compatibility with the PC, trade, contests, mail, Battle Dome. Examples:

* Icons share palettes with front sprites, meaning that shiny pokemon will also have shiny icons!

**lighting** branch:
* Everything from the **followers** branch.
* Day/night shading compatible with weather.
* GSC-style window lights.
* WIP interframe-blended lamp lights at night, i.e in Rustboro.
* HGSS-style alpha-blended shadows for object events.

Certain mechanics, moves, abilities and species sprites are missing. For more information, see [the project's milestones](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/milestones).
